# Code Information
I developed this in Python 3.10, so remember to not run it with a version lower than that.

I wrote this to easily decode BeaverScratch for myself for the game Shipwrecked64.
I don't recommend the approach I took here for how to code "WELL-MADE" shift cipher decoders.
Most basic ciphers use modulus in some respect, however it seemed like BeaverScratch was different
as my approaches didn't work, so I brute forced the codex you see below.

Obviously there are way better ways to code this, and I simply hard coded the codex to just have a quick tool.
But hopefully for those wishing to understand more about cryptography this gives you insight.

And remember this is a terminal application, so no GUI, sorry not sorry.
