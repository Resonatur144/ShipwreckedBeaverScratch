# Introduction
This is a simple python project, that you can load in your favorite IDE
for decoding the BeaverScratch found within the game Shipwrecked64.

I developed it in PyCharm, and used it to read most of the signs within the game.

Simply open the folder BeaverScratchPy in your IDE.
Beyond that, I won't offer assistance, if you can't figure that out, you should come
back when you get older.
